# Parametric Thresholding Signal Analysis

This project explores thresholding as a nonlinear, time-invariant operation used in signal segmentation and image processing. It combines mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and practical implementation using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Whether you're analyzing signals, segmenting images, or studying Gaussian distributions, this notebook walks through the theory and practice — step by step.


## Code Backbone
The notebook is organized into the following sections:
1. Introduction to Thresholding
   - Nonlinearity and time-invariance explained with signal examples
2. Global vs Optimal Thresholding
   - Signal segmentation using fixed and adaptive thresholds
3. Segmentation Errors
   - Statistical modeling using Gaussian distributions
4. Central Limit Theorem
   - Demonstration with synthetic data
5. Iterative Parametric Thresholding
   - Image segmentation using statistical refinement
6. Visualizations
   - Histograms, Gaussian curves, and thresholded images

## ⚙️ Requirements
To run this project, install the following Python libraries:
 numpy . matplotlib . opencv-python . pandas . notebook . ipykernel
